      The idea is to demonstrate the beauty and power of Alexandrov
      geometry by reaching interesting applications and theorems with a
      minimum of preparation.
      These notes arise as an offshoot of the book on Alexandrov
      geometry we have been writing for a number of years. The notes
      were shaped in a number of lectures given by the third author to
      undergraduate students at different occasions
      at the <a
href="https://www.math.psu.edu/mass/content/mathematics-advanced-study-semesters">MASS
        program at Penn State University</a> and the <a
        href="http://bogomolov-lab.ru/SHKOLA2016/index.html">Summer
        School “Algebra and Geometry” in Yaroslavl</a>.

      Chapter 1 includes the necessary preliminaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Chapter 2, we discuss the Reshetnyak gluing theorem and apply
      it to a problem in billiards which was solved by Dmitri Burago,
      Serge
      Ferleger and Alexey Kononenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Chapter 3, we discuss the Hadamard–Cartan globalization
      theorem, and apply it to the construction of exotic aspherical
      manifolds
      introduced by Michael Davis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Chapter 4, we discuss examples of Alexandrov spaces with
      curvature bounded above. This chapter is based largely on work of
      Samuel
      Shefel on nonsmooth saddle surfaces.
