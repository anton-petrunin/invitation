<h2>Invitation to Alexandrov geometry: CAT(0) spaces</h2>
<p> 
Here you can find the latest draft of our book <A href="invitation.pdf"><em><big>Invitation to Alexandrov geometry: CAT(0) spaces</big></em></A>;
soon it should be published in <A href="https://www.springer.com/series/10030">SpringerBriefs in Mathematics</A>.
</p>
<p>
These notes arise as an offshoot of the book on Alexandrov geometry we have been writing for a number of years. 
The notes were shaped in a number of lectures given by the third author to undergraduate students at different occasions
at the <A href="https://www.math.psu.edu/mass/content/mathematics-advanced-study-semesters">MASS program at Penn State University</A> and the <A href="http://bogomolov-lab.ru/SHKOLA2016/index.html">Summer School “Algebra and Geometry” in Yaroslavl</A>.
The idea is to demonstrate the beauty and power of Alexandrov geometry by reaching interesting applications and theorems with a
minimum of preparation.
</p>
<p>
In Chapter 1, we discuss necessary preliminaries.
</p>
<p>
In Chapter 2, we discuss the Reshetnyak gluing theorem and apply
it to a problem in billiards which was solved by Dmitri Burago, Serge
Ferleger and Alexey Kononenko.
</p>
<p>
In Chapter 3, we discuss the Hadamard–Cartan globalization theorem, and apply it to the construction of exotic aspherical manifolds
introduced by Michael Davis.
</p>
<p>
In Chapter 4, we discuss examples of Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded above. This chapter is based largely on work of Samuel
Shefel on nonsmooth saddle surfaces.
