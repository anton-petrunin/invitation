The idea is to demonstrate the beauty and power of Alexandrov geometry by reaching interesting applications and theorems with a
minimum of preparation.
These notes arise as an offshoot of the book on Alexandrov geometry we have been writing for a number of years. 
The notes were shaped in a number of lectures given by the third author to undergraduate students at different occasions
at the <A href="https://www.math.psu.edu/mass/content/mathematics-advanced-study-semesters">MASS program at Penn State University</A> and the <A href="http://bogomolov-lab.ru/SHKOLA2016/index.html">Summer School “Algebra and Geometry” in Yaroslavl</A>.

Chapter 1 includes the necessary preliminaries.
</p>
<p>
In Chapter 2, we discuss the Reshetnyak gluing theorem and apply
it to a problem in billiards which was solved by Dmitri Burago, Serge
Ferleger and Alexey Kononenko.
</p>
<p>
In Chapter 3, we discuss the Hadamard–Cartan globalization theorem, and apply it to the construction of exotic aspherical manifolds
introduced by Michael Davis.
</p>
<p>
In Chapter 4, we discuss examples of Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded above. This chapter is based largely on work of Samuel
Shefel on nonsmooth saddle surfaces.
