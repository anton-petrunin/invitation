Consider the space $\mathcal{M}_4$ of all isometry classes of 4-point metric space.
Each element in $\mathcal{M}_4$ can be described by 6 numbers 
 --- the distances between all 6 pairs of its points, say $\ell_{i,j}$ for $1\le i< j\le 4$ modulo permutations of $(1,2,3,4)$.
These 6 numbers is subject to 12 triangle inequalities; that is,
\[\ell_{i,j}+\ell_{j,k}\ge \ell_{i,k}\]
holds for all $i$, $j$ and $k$; here we assume that $\ell_{j,i}=\ell_{i,j}$ and $\ell_{i,i}=0$.

Consider the subset $\mathcal{E}_4\subset \mathcal{M}_4$ of all isometry classes of metric spaces which admit an isometric embedding into Euclidean space.
The complement $\mathcal{M}_4\backslash \mathcal{E}_4$ has two connected components.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Prove the latter statement.
\end{thm}


One of the component will be denoted by $\mathcal{P}_4$ and the other by $\mathcal{N}_4$.
Here $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ stay for \emph{positive} 
and \emph{negative curvature} because spheres have no quadrouples of type $\mathcal{N}_4$ and hyperbolic plane has no quadrouples of type $\mathcal{P}_4$.

If a space with an intrinsic metric has no quadruples of points of type $\mathcal{P}_4$ or $\mathcal{N}_4$ 
are called Alexandrov space with non-positive or non-negative curvature correspondingly.

Here is an exercise, solving which would force the reader to rebuild considrable part of the theory.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Assume $\spc{X}$ is a complete metric space with intrinsic metric
which contains only quadruples of type $\mathcal{E}_4$.
Show that $\spc{X}$ is isometric to the convex set in a Hilbert space.
\end{thm}

In fact it would be helpful to think about this exercise for a couple of days before you proceed on reading.

Instead of Euclidean space, one takes hyperbolic space,
one arrives to the definition of spaces with curvature bounded above or below by $-1$.
To define spaces with curvature bounded above or below by $1$,
one has to take unit 3-dimesional sphere instead,
and allow to check only quadrouples of points such that each of the 4 triangles has perimeter at most $2\cdot\pi$.
The later condition could be thought as a part of \emph{spherical triangle inequality}.
