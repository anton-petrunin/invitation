Consider the space $\mathcal{M}_4$ of all isometry classes of 4-point metric spaces.
Each element in $\mathcal{M}_4$ can be described by 6 numbers 
 --- the distances between all 6 pairs of its points, say $\ell_{i,j}$ for $1\le i< j\le 4$ modulo permutations of $(1,2,3,4)$.
These 6 numbers are subject to 12 triangle inequalities; that is,
\[\ell_{i,j}+\ell_{j,k}\ge \ell_{i,k}\]
holds for all $i$, $j$ and $k$, where we assume that $\ell_{j,i}=\ell_{i,j}$ and $\ell_{i,i}=0$.

Consider the subset $\mathcal{E}_4\subset \mathcal{M}_4$ of all isometry classes of metric spaces which admit an isometric embedding into Euclidean space.
The complement $\mathcal{M}_4\backslash \mathcal{E}_4$ has two connected components.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:two-components-of-M4}
Prove the latter statement.
\end{thm}


One of the components will be denoted by $\mathcal{P}_4$ and the other by $\mathcal{N}_4$.
Here $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ stand for {}\emph{positive} 
and {}\emph{negative curvature} because spheres have no quadruples of type $\mathcal{N}_4$ and the hyperbolic plane has no quadruples of type $\mathcal{P}_4$.

A metric space, with length metric, 
which has no quadruples of points of type $\mathcal{P}_4$ or $\mathcal{N}_4$ 
is called an Alexandrov space with non-positive or non-negative curvature respectively.

Here is an exercise, solving which would force the reader to rebuild a considerable part of Alexandrov geometry.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:convex-set}
Assume $\spc{X}$ is a complete metric space with length metric 
containing only quadruples of type $\mathcal{E}_4$.
Show that $\spc{X}$ is isometric to a convex set in a Hilbert space.
\end{thm}

In fact, it might be helpful to spend some time thinking about this exercise before proceeding.

In the definition above, 
instead of the Euclidean space, 
one can take the hyperbolic plane.
In this case
one obtains the definition of spaces with curvature bounded above or below by $-1$.

To define spaces with curvature bounded above or below by $1$,
one has to take the unit 3-sphere instead,
and specify that only the quadruples of points such that each of the four triangles has perimeter at most $2\cdot\pi$ are checked.
The latter condition could be thought as a part of the {}\emph{spherical triangle inequality}.

These notes arise as a coproduct of the book in Alexandrov geometry
we have been writing for  a number of years.
The notes were shaped in a number of lectures given by Anton Petrunin 
to undergraduate students 
at different  occasions at the
MASS program at Penn State University
and the Summer School ``Algebra and Geometry'' in Yaroslavl.
