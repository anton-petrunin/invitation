\chapter{Preliminaries}

In this chapter we fix some conventions assuming that the reader is familiar with basic notions in metric geometry.

\section{Metric spaces}
\label{sec:metric spaces}


The distance between two points $x$ and $y$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$ will be denoted by $\dist{x}{y}{}$ or $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$
if we need to emphasize 
that the distance is taken in the space ${\spc{X}}$.

The function $y\mapsto \dist{x}{y}{}$ is called \emph{distance function}\index{distance function} from $x$ and denoted as  $\dist{x}{}{}$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{diameter}\index{Diameter} of metric space $\spc{X}$ is defined as
\[\diam \spc{X}=\sup\set{\dist{x}{y}{}}{x,y\in \spc{X}}.\]

\item Given $R\in[0,\infty]$ and $x\in \spc{X}$, the sets
\begin{align*}
\oBall(x,R)&=\{y\in \spc{X}\mid \dist{x}{y}{}<R\},
\\
\cBall[x,R]&=\{y\in \spc{X}\mid \dist{x}{y}{}\le R\}
\end{align*}
are called respectively the  \emph{open}\index{open ball} and  the \emph{closed  balls}\index{closed ball}   of radius $R$ with center $x$.
 If we need to emphasize that these balls are taken in the metric space $\spc{X}$,
we write 
\[\oBall(x,R)_{\spc{X}}\quad\text{and}\quad\cBall[x,R]_{\spc{X}}\]
correspondingly.

\item
For subsets $A, B\subset \spc{X}$, 
we define the distance between $A$ and $B$  as 
\[\dist{A}{B}{}
\df
\inf\set{\dist{a}{b}{}}{a\in A,\ b\in B}.\]
\item
For any subset $A\subset\spc{X}$,  the sets
\begin{align*}
\oBall(A,R)&=\{y\in \spc{X}\mid \dist{A}{y}{}<R\},
\\
\cBall[A,R]&=\{y\in \spc{X}\mid \dist{A}{y}{}\le R\}
\end{align*}
are called respectively the  \emph{open}\index{open tubular neighborhood} and \emph{closed $R$-neighborhoods}\index{closed neighborhood} of $A$.
\end{itemize}

A metric space $\spc{X}$ is called \emph{proper}\index{proper space} if all closed bounded sets in $\spc{X}$ are compact. 
This condition is equivalent to each of the following statements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For some (and therefore any) point $p\in \spc{X}$ and any $R<\infty$, 
the closed ball $\cBall[p,R]\subset\spc{X}$ is compact. 
\item The function $\dist{p}{}{}\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ is proper for some (and therefore any) point $p\in \spc{X}$.
\end{enumerate}

The following two propositions are standard and easy to prove.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Proper metric spaces are second-countable.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{compact=seq-compact}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item $\spc{X}$ is compact;
\item $\spc{X}$ is \emph{sequentially compact}, that is, any sequence of points in $\spc{X}$ contains a convergent subsequence;
\item $\spc{X}$ is complete and for any $\eps>0$ there is a finite $\eps$-net in $\spc{X}$, that is, there is a finite collection of points $p_1,\ldots,p_{N}$ such that $\cup_i\oBall(p_i,\eps)=\spc{X}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

Recall that a family of maps between metric spaces $\{f_\alpha\co \spc{X}\to\spc{Y}\}_{\alpha\in\mathcal A}$ is called \emph{equicontinuous} if for any $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that for any $p,q\in\spc{X}$ with $\dist{p}{q}{}<\delta$ and any $\alpha\in\mathcal A$ it holds that $\dist{f(p)}{f(q)}{}<\eps$.
\begin{thm}{Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem}\cite[Lemma 3.10]{BH}

Let  $\{f_\alpha\co \spc{X}\to\spc{Y}\}_{\alpha\in\mathcal A}$  be an equicontinuous family  of maps where $\spc{Y}$ is compact and $\spc{X}$ is separable. 

Then $\{f_\alpha\}$ contains a uniformly convergent subsequence $f_{\alpha_i}\to f\co\spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$.
\end{thm}

\section{Constructions}\label{sec:constructions}

Given two metric spaces $\spc{U}$ and $\spc{V}$, the \emph{product space} 
$\spc{U}\times\spc{V}$ is defined as the set of all pairs $(u,v)$ in the set $\spc{U}\times\spc{V}$ 
with the metric defined by formulas
\[\dist{(u^1,v^1)}{(u^2,v^2)}{\spc{U}\times\spc{V}}=\sqrt{\dist[2]{u^1}{u^2}{\spc{U}}+\dist[2]{v^1}{v^2}{\spc{V}}}.\]

\section{Geodesics, triangles and hinges}
\label{sec:geods}

\parbf{Geodesics.}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space 
and $\II$\index{$\II$} be a real interval. 
A globally isometric map $\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is called a \emph{unit-speed geodesic}\index{unit-speed geodesic}%
\footnote{Various authors call it differently: \emph{shortest path}, \emph{minimizing geodesic}.}; 
in other words, $\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is a unit-speed geodesic if 
\[\dist{\gamma(s)}{\gamma(t)}{\spc{X}}=|s-t|\]
for any pair $s,t\in \II$.

A unit-speed geodesic $\gamma\:\RR_{\ge0}\to \spc{X}$ is called a \emph{ray}\index{ray}.

A unit-speed geodesic  $\gamma\:\RR\to \spc{X}$ is called a \emph{line}\index{line}.

%geodesic between points is not defined???
A unit-speed geodesic between $p$ and $q$ in $\spc{X}$ will be denoted by $\geod_{[p q]}$\index{$\geod_{[{*}{*}]}$}.
We assume $\geod_{[p q]}$ is parametrized starting at $p$; 
that is, $\geod_{[p q]}(0)=p$ and $\geod_{[p q]}(\dist{p}{q}{})=q$.
The image of $\geod_{[p q]}$ will be denoted by $[p q]$\index{$[{*}{*}]$} and called a \emph{geodesic}\index{geodesic}.
The term \emph{geodesic}\index{geodesic} will also be used for  a linear reparametrization of a unit-speed geodesic;
when a confusion is possible we call the latter a \emph{constant-speed geodesic}\index{constantspeed geodesic}.
%???MAYBE BETTER CALL IT GEODESIC CURVE???
%%%%%%%%???MAYBE BETTER TO KEEP CONSTANTSPEED GEODESIC. IT IS CLEAR.  A GEODESIC CURVE POSSIBLY MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT PARAMETER. WE SHOULD NOT EVEN RAISE THIS POSSIBILITY IN THE READER'S MIND.
%%%%%%%%%%%S:  SORRY BUT I NEED OTHER PARAMETERS IN WARPED PRODUCTS.  SO CAN WE CALL THESE ``PREGEODESICS'''AS IN BRIDSON-HAEFLIGER.
With slight abuse of notation, we will use $[p q]$ also for the class of all linear reparametrizations of $\geod_{[p q]}$.

We may write $[p q]_{\spc{X}}$ 
to emphasize that the geodesic $[p q]$ is in the space  ${\spc{X}}$.
Also we use the following short-cut notation:
\begin{align*}
\l] p q \r[&=[pq]\backslash\{p,q\},
&
\l] p q \r]&=[pq]\backslash\{p\},
&
\l[ p q \r[&=[pq]\backslash\{q\}.
\end{align*}



In general, a geodesic between $p$ and $q$ need not exist and if it exists, it need not to be unique.  However,  once we write $\geod_{[p q]}$ or $[p q]$ we mean that we made a choice of geodesic.

A metric space is called \emph{geodesic}\index{geodesic} if any pair of its points can be jointed by a geodesic. 

A constant-speed geodesic $\gamma\:[0,1]\to\spc{X}$ is called a \emph{geodesic path}\index{geodesic path}.
Given a geodesic $[p q]$,
we denote by $\geodpath_{[pq]}$ the corresponding geodesic path;
that is,
$$\geodpath_{[pq]}(t)\z\equiv\geod_{[pq]}(t\cdot\dist[{{}}]{p}{q}{}).$$

A curve $\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$  is called a \emph{local geodesic}\index{geodesic!local geodesic}, if for any $t\in\II$ there is a neighborhood $U\ni t$ in $\II$ such that the restriction $\gamma|_U$ is a constant-speed geodesic.  If $\II=[0,1]$, then $\gamma$ is called a \emph{local geodesic path}.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:busemann}
Suppose $\spc{X}$ is a metric space and $\gamma\:[0,\infty)\to \spc{X}$ is a ray. 
Then the \index{Busemann function}\emph{Busemann function} $\bus_\gamma\:\spc{X}\to \RR$ 
\[\bus_\gamma(x)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\dist{\gamma(t)}{x}{}- t\eqlbl{eq:def:busemann*}\]
is defined
and $1$-Lipschitz.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
As  follows from the triangle inequality, the function \[t\mapsto\dist{\gamma(t)}{x}{}- t\] is nonincreasing in $t$.  
Clearly $\dist{\gamma(t)}{x}{}- t\ge-\dist{\gamma(0)}{x}{}$.
Thus the limit in \ref{eq:def:busemann*} is defined.
\qeds

\parbf{Triangles.}
For a triple of points $p,q,r\in \spc{X}$, a choice of triple of geodesics $([q r], [r p], [p q])$ will be called a \emph{triangle}\index{triangle} and we will use short notation 
$\trig p q r=([q r], [r p], [p q])$\index{$\trig {{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$}.
Again given a triple $p,q,r\in \spc{X}$ it may be no triangle 
$\trig p q r$ simply because one of the pairs of these points can not be joined by a geodesic, and also it maybe many different triangles with these vertexes, any of which can be denoted by $\trig p q r$.
Once we write $\trig p q r$, it means we made a choice of such a triangle, 
that is, a choice of each $[q r], [r p]$ and $[p q]$.
The value $\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}+\dist{r}{p}{}$ will be called \emph{perimeter of triangle} $\trig p q r$;
it obviousely coinsides with perimeter of triple $p$, $q$, $r$ defined below.

\parbf{Hinges.}
Let $p,x,y\in \spc{X}$ be a triple of points such that $p$ is distinct from $x$ and $y$.
A pair geodesics $([p x],[p y])$ will be called \emph{hinge}\index{hinge} and briefly, it will be denoted by 
$\hinge p x y=([p x],[p y])$\index{$\hinge{{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$}.


\parbf{Convex sets.}\label{def:convex-set}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space. 
A set $A\subset\spc{X}$ is called 
\emph{convex}%
\index{convex set}
if for every two points $p,q\in A$ there every geodesic $[pq]$ of $\spc{X}$ 
lies in $A$.

A set $A\subset\spc{X}$ is called 
\emph{locally convex}
if every point $a\in A$ admits an open neighborhood $\Omega\ni a$
such that for every two points $p,q\in A\cap\Omega$ every geodesic $[pq]\subset \Omega$ lies in $A$.


Note that any open set is locally convex by definition.

\section{Length spaces}\label{sec:intrinsic}

Recall that a curve is a continuous map from a real interval to a space.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and
$\alpha\: \II\to \spc{X}$ is a curve.
We define the \emph{length}\index{length} of $\alpha$ as 
\[
\length \alpha \df \sup_{t_0\le t_1\le\ldots\le t_n}\sum_i \dist{\alpha(t_i)}{\alpha_{i+1}}{}
\]
\end{thm}
It is easy to see that if $\tau\co [c,d]\to [a,b]$ is monotonic onto function then $\length \alpha=\length(\alpha\circ\tau)$.


Given two points $x$ and $y$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$
consider the value
\[\yetdist{x}{y}{}=\inf_{\alpha}\{\length\alpha\},\]
where infimum is taken for all paths $\alpha$ from $x$ to $y$.

If the value $\yetdist{x}{y}{}$ is finite for any pair of points $x$ and $y$ then $\yetdist{}{}{}$ defines a metric on  $\spc{X}$;
it will be called the induced \emph{length-metric}\index{length-metric} on $\spc{X}$.

In this book, most of the time we consider length spaces.
If $\spc{X}$ is length space, 
and $A\subset \spc{X}$.
The set $A$ comes with the inherited metric from $\spc{X}$ 
which might be not a length-metric.
The corresponding length-metric on $A$ will be denoted as $\dist{}{}{A}$.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
If $\yetdist{x}{y}{}=\dist{x}{y}{}$ for any pair of points $x,y\in\spc{X}$  then $\spc{X}$ is called a \emph{length space}\index{length space}.
\end{thm}
In other words, a metric space $\spc{X}$ is a
\emph{length space}
if for any $\eps>0$ and any two points $x,y\in \spc{X}$  there is a path $\alpha\:[0,1]\to\spc{X}$ connecting%
\footnote{That is, such that $\alpha(0)=x$ and $\alpha(1)=y$.}
 $x$ to $y$
such that 
\[\length\alpha<\dist{x}{y}{}+\eps.\]

Note that any geodesic space is a length space;
as you see from the following example, the contrary does not hold.


\begin{thm}{Example}
Let $\spc{X}$ be obtained by gluing a countable collection of disjoint intervals $I_i$ of length $1+1/i$ where for each $I_i$ one end is glued to $p=\{0\}$ and the other to $q=\{1\}$.
Then $\spc{X}$ carries a natural complete length metric  with respect to which $\dist{p}{q}{}=1$ but there is no geodesic connecting $p$ to $q$.
\end{thm}



\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:no-geod}
Give an example of a complete length space for which no pair of distinct points can be joined by a geodesic.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and $x,y\in\spc{X}$.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item A point $z\in \spc{X}$ is called a \emph{midpoint} of $x$ and $y$
if 
\[\dist{x}{z}{}=\dist{y}{z}{}=\tfrac12\cdot\dist[{{}}]{x}{y}{}.\]
\item Assume $\eps\ge 0$.
A point $z\in \spc{X}$ is called \emph{$\eps$-midpoint} of $x$ and $y$
if 
\[\dist{x}{z}{},\dist{y}{z}{}<\tfrac12\cdot\dist[{{}}]{x}{y}{}+\eps.\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

Note that a $0$-midpoint is the same as a midpoint.


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:mid>geod}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete metric space.
\begin{subthm}{lem:mid>length}
Assume that for any pair of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$  
 and any $\eps>0$
there is a $\eps$-midpoint $z$.
Then the space $\spc{X}$ is an $R$-length space.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{lem:mid>geod:geod}
Assume that for any pair of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$ 
such that $\dist{x}{y}{}<R$
there is a midpoint $z$.
Then the space $\spc{X}$ is an $R$-geodesic space.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $x,y\in \spc{X}$ be a pair of points such that $\dist{x}{y}{}<R$.

Set $\eps_n=\frac\eps{2^{2\cdot n}}$.

Set $\alpha(0)=x$ and $\alpha(1)=y$.

Set $\alpha(\tfrac12)$ to be an $\eps_1$-midpoint of $\alpha(0)$ and $\alpha(1)$.
Further, set $\alpha(\frac14)$ 
and $\alpha(\frac34)$ to be $\eps_2$-midpoints 
for the pairs $(\alpha(0),\alpha(\tfrac12)$ 
and $(\alpha(\tfrac12),\alpha(1)$ respectively.
Applying the above procedure recursively,
on the $n$-th step we define $\alpha(\tfrac{\kay}{2^n})$
for every odd integer $\kay$ such that $0<\tfrac\kay{2^n}<1$, 
as an $\eps_{n}$-midpoint of the already defined
$\alpha(\tfrac{\kay-1}{2^n})$ and $\alpha(\tfrac{\kay+1}{2^n})$.


In this way we define $\alpha(t)$ for $t\in W$,
where $W$ denotes the set of dyadic rationals in $[0,1]$.
For any $t\in[0,1]$ consider a sequence of $t_n\in W$ such that $t_n\to t$ as $n\to\infty$.
Note that the sequence $\alpha(t_n)$ converges;
define $\alpha(t)$ as its limit.
It is easy to see that $\alpha(t)$
does not depend on the choice of the sequence $t_n$
and $\alpha\:[0,1]\to\spc{X}$ is a path from $x$ to $y$.
Moreover,
\[\begin{aligned}
\length\alpha&\le \dist{x}{y}{}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{n-1}\cdot\eps_n\le
\\
&\le \dist{x}{y}{}+\tfrac\eps2.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:eps-midpoint}
\]
Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary, we get (\ref{SHORT.lem:mid>length}).

To prove (\ref{SHORT.lem:mid>geod:geod}), 
one should repeat the same argument 
taking midpoints instead of $\eps_n$-midpoints.
In this case \ref{eq:eps-midpoint} holds for $\eps_n=\eps=0$.
\qeds

Since in a compact space a sequence of $1/n$-midpoints $z_n$ contains a convergent subsequence, Lemma  \ref{lem:mid>geod} immediately implies

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
A proper length space is geodesic.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Hopf--Rinow theorem}\label{thm:Hopf-Rinow}
Any complete, locally compact length space is proper.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a locally compact length space.
Given $x\in \spc{X}$, denote by $\rho(x)$ the supremum of all $R>0$ such that
the closed ball $\cBall[x,R]$ is compact.
Since $\spc{X}$ is locally compact 
$$\rho(x)>0\ \ \text{for any}\ \ x\in \spc{X}.\eqlbl{eq:rho>0}$$
It is sufficient to show that $\rho(x)=\infty$ for some (and therefore any) point $x\in \spc{X}$.

Assume the contrary; that is, $\rho(x)<\infty$.

\begin{clm}{} $B=\cBall[x,\rho(x)]$ is compact for any $x$.
\end{clm}

Indeed, $\spc{X}$ is a length space;
therefore for any $\eps>0$, 
the set $\cBall[x,\rho(x)-\eps]$ is a compact $\eps$-net in $B$.
Since $B$ is closed and hence complete, it has to be compact by Proposition~\ref{compact=seq-compact}.
\claimqeds

\begin{clm}{} $|\rho(x)-\rho(y)|\le \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$,
in particular $\rho\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ is a continuous function.
\end{clm}

Indeed, 
assume the contrary; that is, $\rho(x)+|x-y|<\rho(y)$ for some $x,y\in \spc{X}$. 
Then 
$\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\eps]$ is a closed subset of $\cBall[y,\rho(y)]$ for some $\eps>0$.
Then  compactness of $\cBall[y,\rho(y)]$ implies compactness of $\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\eps]$, a contradiction.\claimqeds

Set $\eps=\min_{y\in B}\{\rho(y)\}$; 
the minimum is defined since $B$ is compact.
From \ref{eq:rho>0}, we have $\eps>0$.

Choose a finite $\tfrac\eps{10}$-net $\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\}$ in $B$.
The union $W$ of the closed balls $\cBall[a_i,\eps]$ is compact.
Clearly 
$\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\frac\eps{10}]\subset W$.
Therefore $\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\frac\eps{10}]$ is compact;
a contradiction.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}(from \cite{BH})\label{exercise from BH}
Construct a geodesic space which is locally compact,
but whose completion is neither geodesic nor locally compact.
\end{thm}

\section{Model angles and triangles.}\label{sec:mod-tri/angles}

Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space, 
$p,q,r\in \spc{X}$ 
and $\kappa\in\RR$. 
Let us define its \emph{model triangle}\index{model triangle} $\trig{\~p}{\~q}{\~r}$ 
(briefly, 
$\trig{\~p}{\~q}{\~r}=\modtrig\kappa(p q r)$%
\index{$\modtrig\kappa$!$\modtrig\kappa({*}{*}{*})$}) to be a triangle in the model plane $\Lob2\kappa$ such that
\[\dist{\~p}{\~q}{}=\dist{p}{q}{},
\ \ \dist{\~q}{\~r}{}=\dist{q}{r}{},
\ \ \dist{\~r}{\~p}{}=\dist{r}{p}{}.\]

In the notation of Section~\ref{model}, 
$\modtrig\kappa(p q r)=\modtrig\kappa\{\dist{q}{r}{},\dist{r}{p}{},\dist{p}{q}{}\}$.

If $\kappa\le 0$ model triangle allways defined, it exists and unique up to isometry of $\Lob2\kappa$.
If $\kappa>0$, the model triangle is said to be defined if in addition
\[\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}+\dist{r}{p}{}< 2\cdot\varpi\kappa.\]
In this case it also exists and unique up to isometry of $\Lob2\kappa$.
The value $\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}+\dist{r}{p}{}$ will be called \emph{perimeter of triple} $p$, $q$, $r$.

If for  $p,q,r\in \spc{X}$,
$\trig{\~p}{\~q}{\~r}=\modtrig\kappa(p q r)$ is defined 
and $\dist{p}{q}{},\dist{p}{r}{}>0$, the angle measure of 
$\trig{\~p}{\~q}{\~r}$ at $\~ p$ will be called \emph{model angle} of triple $p$, $q$, $r$ and it will be denoted by
$\angk\kappa p q r$%
\index{$\tangle\mc\kappa$!$\angk\kappa{{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$}.

In the notation of Section~\ref{model}, 
$\angk\kappa p q r=\tangle\mc\kappa\{\dist{q}{r}{};\dist{p}{q}{},\dist{p}{r}{}\}$.

\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{35mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(-10mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/lem_alex1(0.4)}
\lbl[br]{17,59;$p$}
\lbl[r]{1,2;$q$}
\lbl[l]{86,13;$r$}
\lbl[lb]{67,32;$z$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\begin{thm}{Alexandrov's lemma}
\index{Alexandrov's lemma}
\index{lemma!Alexandrov's lemma}
\label{lem:alex}  
Let $p,q,r,z$ be distinct points in a metric space such that $z\in \l]p r\r[$ and 
\[\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}+\dist{r}{p}{}< 2\cdot\varpi\kappa.\]
Then 
the following expressions have the same sign:
\begin{subthm}{lem-alex-difference}
$\angk\kappa p q z
-\angk\kappa p q r$,
\end{subthm} 

\begin{subthm}{lem-alex-angle}
$\angk\kappa z q p
+\angk\kappa z q r -\pi$.
\end{subthm}

Moreover,
\[\angk\kappa q p r \ge \angk\kappa q p z +  \angk\kappa q z r,\]
with equality if and only if the expressions in (\ref{SHORT.lem-alex-difference}) and (\ref{SHORT.lem-alex-angle}) vanish.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} By the triangle inequality, 
\[
\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{z}{}+\dist{z}{p}{}\le \dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}+\dist{r}{p}{}< 2\cdot\varpi\kappa.
\]
Therefore the model triangle $\trig{\~p}{\~q}{\~z}=\modtrig\kappa p q z$ is defined.
Take 
a point $\~r$ on the extension of 
$[\~p \~z]$ beyond $\~z$ so that $\dist{\~p}{\~r}{}=\dist{p}{r}{}$ (and therefore $\dist{\~p}{\~z}{}=\dist{p}{z}{}$). 
 
From monotonicity of function $a\mapsto\tangle\mc\kappa\{a;b,c\}$ (\ref{increase}), 
the following expressions have the same sign:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\mangle\hinge{\~p}{\~q}{\~r}-\angk\kappa{p}{q}{r}$;
\item $\dist{\~p}{\~r}{}-\dist{p}{r}{}$;
\item $\mangle\hinge{\~z}{\~q}{\~r}-\angk\kappa{z}{q}{r}$.
\end{enumerate}
Since 
\[\mangle\hinge{\~p}{\~q}{\~r}=\mangle\hinge{\~p}{\~q}{\~z}=\angk\kappa{p}{q}{z}\]
and
\[ \mangle\hinge{\~z}{\~q}{\~r}
=\pi-\mangle\hinge{\~z}{\~p}{\~q}
=\pi-\angk\kappa{z}{p}{q},\]
the first statement follows.

For the second statement, construct $\trig{\~q}{\~z}{r'}=\modtrig\kappa q z r$ on the opposite side of $[\~q\~z]$ from $\trig{\~p}{\~q}{\~z}$.  
Since
\[\dist{\~p}{r'}{}\le \dist{\~p}{\~z}{} + \dist{\~z}{r'}{}=\dist{p}{z}{}+\dist{z}{r}{}=\dist{p}{r}{},\]
then 
\begin{align*}
\angk\kappa{q}{p}{z} + \angk\kappa{q}{z}{r} 
&
= 
\mangle\hinge{\~q}{\~p}{\~z}+ \mangle\hinge{\~q}{\~z}{r'} 
=
\\
&
= 
\mangle\hinge{\~q}{\~p}{r'}
\le
\\
&\le  \angk\kappa q p r.
\end{align*}
Equality holds if and only  if $\dist{\~p}{r'}{}=\dist{p}{r}{}$, 
as required.

\section{Angles and the first variation.}\label{sec:angles}

Given a hinge $\hinge p x y$, we define its \emph{angle}\index{angle} as 
follows:\index{$\mangle$!$\mangle\hinge{{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$}
\[\mangle\hinge p x y
\df
\lim_{\bar x,\bar y\to p} \angk\kappa p{\bar x}{\bar y},\]
where $\bar x\in\l]p x\r]$ and $\bar y\in\l]p y\r]$.

Similarly to $\angk\kappa p{x}{y}$, 
we will use short notation\index{$\side\kappa$!$\side\kappa \hinge{{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$}
\[\side\kappa \hinge p x y=
\side\kappa \l\{\mangle\hinge p x y;\dist{p}{x}{},\dist{p}{y}{}\r\}.\]
The value $\side\kappa \hinge p x y$ will be called the  \emph{model side}
 of hinge $\hinge p x y$.Ð

\parbf{Remark.}\label{page:upper-angle}
We stick to this definition since in Alexandrov's geometry angles always defined (see Theorem~\ref{angle} and Corollary~\ref{cor:monoton-cba:angle=inf}).
For general metric spaces, the angle need not be defined\index{$\mangle$!$\mangle^\text{up}$}
and it is more natural to consider \emph{upper angle}\index{angle!upper angle} which is defined as
\[\mangle^\text{up}\hinge p x y

A good discussion of different definition of angles is given in ???.


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:k-K-angle}
For any $\kappa,\Kappa\in\RR$, there exists  $\Const\in\RR$ such that
\[|\angk\Kappa p{x}{y}-\angk\kappa p{x}{y}|
\le 
\Const\cdot\dist[{{}}]{p}{x}{}\cdot\dist[{{}}]{p}{y}{},
\eqlbl{eq:k-K}\]
whenever  the lefthand side is defined.
\end{thm}

Lemma~\ref{lem:k-K-angle} implies that 
the definition of angle is independent of $\kappa$.
In particular, one can take $\kappa=0$ in the definition, so that the angle can be calculated from the  cosine law:
\[\cos\angk{0}{p}{x}{y}
=
\frac{\dist[2]{p}{x}{}+\dist[2]{p}{y}{}-\dist[2]{x}{y}{}}{2\cdot \dist[{{}}]{p}{x}{}\cdot\dist[{{}}]{p}{y}{}}.\]

\parit{Proof.}
The function $\kappa\mapsto \angk\kappa p{x}{y}$ is nondecreasing (see \ref{k-decrease}).
Thus, for $\Kappa>\kappa$, we have
\begin{align*}
0\le \angk\Kappa p{x}{y}-\angk{\kappa}p{x}{y}
\le& \angk\Kappa p{x}{y}+\angk\Kappa {x}p{y}+\angk\Kappa {y}p{x}-
\\
&-\angk\kappa p{x}{y}-\angk\kappa {x}p{y}-\angk\kappa {y}p{x}
= 
\\
=&\Kappa\cdot\area\modtrig\Kappa(pxy)-\kappa\cdot\area\modtrig\kappa(pxy).
\end{align*}
Thus, \ref{eq:k-K} follows since 
%???WHY???
\[0
\le
\area\modtrig\kappa(pxy)\le \area\modtrig\Kappa(pxy),
%\le
%O\l(\dist[{{}}]{p}{x}{}\cdot\dist[{{}}]{p}{y}{}\r),
\]
%!!!
where the latter area is at most $\dist[{{}}]{p}{x}{}\cdot\dist[{{}}]{p}{y}{}$.

%???It is true without assuming $K\le 0$??? if $K\le 0$ and hence, by central projection from a sphere to its tangent plane, is at most $\tan\dist[{{}}]{p}{x}{}\cdot\tan\dist[{{}}]{p}{y}{}$ if $K=1$.

\begin{thm}{Triangle inequality for angles}
\label{claim:angle-3angle-inq}
Let  $[px^1]$, $[px^2]$ and $[px^3]$ %$\gamma^1, \gamma^2, \gamma^3$ 
be three geodesics in a metric space.
If all of the angles $\alpha^{i j}=\mangle\hinge p {x^i}{x^j}$ are defined then they satisfy the triangle inequality:
\[\alpha^{13}\le \alpha^{12}+\alpha^{23}.\]

\end{thm}

\parbf{Remark.}
The above theorem also holds for upper angles, see the remark on page \pageref{page:upper-angle}.


\parit{Proof.} 
Since $\alpha^{13}\le\pi$, we can assume that $\alpha^{12}+\alpha^{23}< \pi$.
Set $\gamma^i=\geod_{[px^i]}$.
Given any $\eps>0$, for all sufficiently small $t,\tau,s\in\RR_+$ we have
\begin{align*}
\dist{\gamma^1(t)}{\gamma^3(\tau)}{}
\le 
&\dist{\gamma^1(t)}{\gamma^2(s)}{}+\dist{\gamma^2(s)}{\gamma^3(\tau)}{}<\\
<
&\sqrt{t^2+s^2-2\cdot t\cdot  s\cdot \cos(\alpha^{12}+\eps)}+
\\
&+\sqrt{s^2+\tau^2-2\cdot s\cdot \tau\cdot \cos(\alpha^{23}+\eps)}\le
\\
\intertext{(Below we define 
$s(t,\tau)$ so that for 
$s=s(t,\tau)$, this chain of inequalities continues the following way.)}
\le
&\sqrt{t^2+\tau^2-2\cdot t\cdot \tau\cdot \cos(\alpha^{12}+\alpha^{23}+2\cdot \eps)}.
\end{align*}
Thus for any $\eps>0$, 
\[\alpha^{13}\le \alpha^{12}+\alpha^{23}+2\cdot \eps.\]
Hence the result.

\begin{lpic}[t(-0mm),b(-0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/s-choice(0.33)}
\lbl[rb]{45,101;$t$}
\lbl[rt]{45,30;$\tau$}
\lbl[W]{50,65;$s\ \ $}
\lbl[l]{18,60,-25;$=\alpha^{12}+\eps$}
\lbl[l]{18,69,24;$=\alpha^{23}+\eps$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

To define $s(t,\tau)$, consider three rays $\~\gamma^1$, $\~\gamma^2$, $\~\gamma^3$ on a Euclidean plane starting at one point, such that $\mangle(\~\gamma^1,\~\gamma^2)=\alpha^{12}+\eps$, $\mangle(\~\gamma^2,\~\gamma^3)=\alpha^{23}+\eps$ and $\mangle(\~\gamma^1,\~\gamma^3)=\alpha^{12}+\alpha^{23}+2\cdot \eps$.
We parametrize each ray by length from the starting point.
Given two positive numbers $t,\tau\in\RR_+$, let $s=s(t,\tau)$ be %a 
the 
number such that 
$\~\gamma^2(s)\in[\~\gamma^1(t)\ \~\gamma^3(\tau)]$. Clearly $s\le\max\{t,\tau\}$, 
so $t,\tau,s$ may be taken sufficiently small.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Prove that the sum of adjacent angles is at least $\pi$.

More precisely: let $\spc{X}$ be a complete length space and $p,x,y,z\in \spc{X}$.
If $p\in \l] x y \r[$, then 
\[\mangle\hinge pxz+\mangle\hinge pyz\ge \pi\]
whenever  each angle on the left-hand side is defined.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{First variation inequality}\label{lem:first-var}
Assume for hinge $\hinge q p x$ 
the angle $\alpha=\mangle\hinge q p x$ is defined then
\[\dist{p}{\geod_{[qx]}(t)}{}
\le
\dist{q}{p}{}-t\cdot \cos\alpha+o(t).\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} Take sufficiently small $\eps>0$.
For all sufficiently small $t>0$, we have that 
\begin{align*}
 \dist{\geod_{[qp]}(t/\eps)}{\geod_{[qx]}(t)}{}
&\le 
\tfrac{t}{\eps}\cdot \sqrt{1+\eps^2 -2\cdot \eps\cdot \cos\alpha}+o(t)\le
\\
&\le \tfrac{t}{\eps} -t\cdot \cos\alpha + t\cdot \eps.
\end{align*}
Applying triangle inequality, we get 
\begin{align*}
\dist{p}{\geod_{[qx]}(t)}{}
&\le \dist{p}{\geod_{[qp]}(t/\eps)}{}+\dist{\geod_{[qp]}(t/\eps)}{\geod_{[qx]}(t)}{}
\le 
\\
&\le
\dist{p}{q}{} -t\cdot \cos\alpha + t\cdot \eps
\end{align*}
for any $\eps>0$ and all sufficiently small $t$.
Hence the result.
