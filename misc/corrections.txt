GENERAL

Table of context: Please use lower letter case (as we agreed on before)

p.13 l.378+p.40 l.2+p43 l.335+p.53 l.142+p.75 l.251+p.75 l.253+p.75 l.264:
Please change the symbol for the empty set --- it seems that you use danish letter Ø, and we prefer the one given by $\varnothing$ in the amssymb package.

p.4 l.107+p.41 l.280+p.78 l.381: i.e. --> that is

change “closest point projection” back to “closest-point projection” everywhere


METADTA

All the math formulas in Metadata for chapters 2,3 and 4 are typeset slightly above the regular text. Please change them to align with the text.

In metadata for chapters 1, 2 and 3 email addresses for Kapovitch and Petrunin are missing. They are given correctly in metadata for chapter 4.

At the end of the abstract for chapter 4 there should not be a period after ?

PREFACE

In section names please only capitalize  the first words and proper names.

Early History of Alexandov Geometry-->Early history of Alexandov geometry

Manifesto of Alexandrov Geometry --> Manifesto of Alexandrov geometry


l.89: Bridson and Haefliger -->  Martin Bridson and André Haefliger
l.90: Ballmann --> Werner Ballmann
l.91: Burago, Burago, and Ivanov --> Dmitri Burago, Yurii Burago, and Sergei Ivanov

AQ1 --- yes, the authors name and location details are correctly included.

CHAPTER 1

p.1-2 l.19-20: Page break between pages 1 and 2  (between lines 19 and 20) in Chapter 1 is awkward. The formula should be on the same page as the preceding sentence describing it.

p.10 l.275-287: the picture is too large, please scale it normally.

p.13 l.374: “$A\ne\emptyset$” --> “$A_\infty\ne\emptyset$”

Line 417: In the displayed formula I would change $\cdots$ to $\ldots$ (or add period at the end of the sentence).

AQ1: leave the sentence as is.

CHAPTER 2
 
p.18 l.46: 

Gluing --> gluing;  

Globalization --> globalization

p.20 l.92: “Adding the first two inequalities of the preceding proof gives.” The period at the end should be changed back to a colon or removed entirely.

l.258: please add = at the begining of the line (to hyphenate the formula) [the code "=\nobreak\discretionary{}{\hbox{$\mathsurround=0pt =$}}{}" does it automatically]

p.29 l. 401: "Let us formulate and prove a corollary of the P
 collision theorem." --> "Let us formulate and prove a corollary of the  collision theorem;
it answers a question formulated by Yakov Sinai \cite{galperin}."

p. 29 I would suggest changing "given on page 27" to "given in section 2.5.
Hard coding page numbers is a bad idea as they might change in further formatting and/or in the other format editions of the book which were are not seeing.

p.30 l. 435 Collision Theorem --> collision theorem

p.30 l. 436 Collision theorem --> collision theorem

p.31 l. 480: add a new paragraph "It was show by Dmitri Burago and Sergei Ivanov \cite{burago-ivanov} that the number of collisions that may occur between $n$ identical balls $\mathbb{R}^3$ grows at least exponentially in $n$."

AQ1: It’s ok to leave the sentence as is or change it to “Hence, continuity and uniqueness in the CAT(0) case follow.”

CHAPTER 3

p.33 l. 5: there should not be a comma after “locally CAT(0) space”

p.34 l. 23: “apath” --> “a path” 

p.35 l. 78:  There is a space missing between “If” and $\mathcal U$

p.40 l. 242: there should be a space around the long dash after “the other way around”

p.40 l. 243: there should be no long dash before “determines the isometry class”

p.40 l. 260: I would change “Step” to “Induction Step” at the beginning of the line.

p. 43 l.331-335: lift the picture up slightly

AQ1: Either leave the sentence as is or change it to “... but one has to consider a homotopy...”

AQ2:  please leave the sentence as is.

AQ3: please use "only if" everywhere

CHAPTER 4

p.50 l. 36: gluing Theorem --> gluing  theorem

p.59 l.337: a space is missing between “a” and “polytope”.

APPENDIX 

p. 70 l.88:  It should read “Note that $\spc{X}$ is locally compact and geodesic.”

p. 71 l.140: add = at the begining of the line (to hyphenate the formula) [the code "=\nobreak\discretionary{}{\hbox{$\mathsurround=0pt =$}}{}" does it automatically]

p.72 l.182: Alexandrov’s  Lemma --> Alexandrov’s  lemma

p.78 l.376: Flag --> flag

p. 78 l.376: Flag --> flag

p. 79 l.424: Inheritance Lemma --> inheritance lemma

p. 79 l.429: Lemma -->  lemma
