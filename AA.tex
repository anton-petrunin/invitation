\section{Main definition}

For a quadruple of points $x,y,p,q$ in a space $\spc{X}$,
consider two model triangles 
$[\~p\~x\~y]$ and $[\~q\~x\~y]$ in the plane $\EE^2$ with shared side $[\~x\~y]$.
We say that the quadruple  $x,y,p,q$ satisfies two-plus-two comparison 
if for any for any point $\~z\in [\~x\~y]$ we have
\[\dist{\~p}{\~z}{\EE^2}+\dist{\~q}{\~z}{\EE^2}\ge\dist{p}{q}{\spc{X}}.\]

If in a space $\spc{X}$ the two-plus-two comparison holds for any quadruple,
we say that $\spc{X}$ is $\cCat{}{0}$.

If instead of Euclidean plane we use unit sphere or Lobachevsky plane,
we get a definition of $\cCat{}{1}$ and $\cCat{}{-1}$ spaces correspondingly.
The only difference comes from the fact that the model triangle for given triple of points in a sphere is not always defined; 
if this is the case for one of two triples $x,y,p$ or $x,y,q$, we assume that spherical two-plus-two comparison holds fro the quadruple of points $x,y,p,q$.
