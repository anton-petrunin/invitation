A unit-speed geodesic $\gamma\:\RR_{\ge0}\to \spc{X}$ is called a \index{ray}\emph{ray}.

A unit-speed geodesic  $\gamma\:\RR\to \spc{X}$ is called a \index{line}\emph{line}.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:busemann}
Suppose $\spc{X}$ is a metric space and $\gamma\:[0,\infty)\to \spc{X}$ is a ray. 
Then the \index{Busemann function}\emph{Busemann function} $\bus_\gamma\:\spc{X}\to \RR$ 
\[\bus_\gamma(x)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\dist{\gamma(t)}{x}{}- t\eqlbl{eq:def:busemann*}\]
is defined
and $1$-Lipschitz.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
As  follows from the triangle inequality, the function \[t\mapsto\dist{\gamma(t)}{x}{}- t\] is nonincreasing in $t$.  
Clearly $\dist{\gamma(t)}{x}{}- t\ge-\dist{\gamma(0)}{x}{}$.
Thus the limit in \ref{eq:def:busemann*} is defined.

\section{Main definition}

For a quadruple of points $x,y,p,q$ in a space $\spc{X}$,
consider two model triangles 
$[\~p\~x\~y]$ and $[\~q\~x\~y]$ in the plane $\EE^2$ with shared side $[\~x\~y]$.
We say that the quadruple  $x,y,p,q$ satisfies two-plus-two comparison 
if for any for any point $\~z\in [\~x\~y]$ we have
\[\dist{\~p}{\~z}{\EE^2}+\dist{\~q}{\~z}{\EE^2}\ge\dist{p}{q}{\spc{X}}.\]

If in a space $\spc{X}$ the two-plus-two comparison holds for any quadruple,
we say that $\spc{X}$ is $\cCat{}{0}$.

If instead of Euclidean plane we use unit sphere or Lobachevsky plane,
we get a definition of $\cCat{}{1}$ and $\cCat{}{-1}$ spaces correspondingly.
The only difference comes from the fact that the model triangle for given triple of points in a sphere is not always defined; 
if this is the case for one of two triples $x,y,p$ or $x,y,q$, we assume that spherical two-plus-two comparison holds fro the quadruple of points $x,y,p,q$.
